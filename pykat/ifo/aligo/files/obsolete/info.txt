- design: A file based on the design parameters for the final aLIGO setup.
  125W input, T_SRM = 20% 
    
- design_low_power: A file based on the design parameters for the final aLIGO setup.
  20W input, T_SRM = 35%. The higher SRM transmission mirror is used for low power
  operation. 20W input power from O1 observation.
        
- design_with_IMC_HAM2: A file based on `design` but has the IMC and HAM2 blocks
  which contain design parameter input optics
    
- design_with_IMC_HAM2_FI_OMC: A file with the OMC and IMC, most complete file


The file 'design_with_IMC_HAM2_FI_OMC' has now been renamed design.kat in the
