This folder is part of the PyKat package and contains a set of 
files python files which together run through the various 
Finesse simulations. 

Finesse: http://www.gwoptics.org/finesse
PyKat:   http://www.gwoptics.org/pykat

The master*py files can be used to generate the Finesse 
results reported in the document:
`Comparing Finesse simulations, analytical solutions and OSCAR 
simulations of Fabry-Perot alignment signals', LIGO-T1300345,
freely available online: http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.5727.
The tasks described in that note were suggested and started at 
the an international workshop for commissioning graviational
wave detectors (28.01.2013 - 02.02.2013, Lousiana, US).

The files are provided as part of PyKat because they provide a 
rich example for using PyKat to automate Finesse simulations.

To run these files you need to have PyKat installed and
the required dependcies (numpy, scipy, matplotlib, pylab).

We recommend to run the files from ipython. To do so,
start ipython and change your system path to include
PyKat, for example:
import sys,os 
sys.path.append("/home/work/git/pykat")

The files must be run in sequence starting with 'master.py':
type `run master.py', which should print various result 
to screen. It will also save temporary data files which are
needed for running master2.py. Similarly running master2.py 
will print further result and save temporary data files. 
master3.py and master4.py both read those temporary files
saved by master2. Both files perform longer running simulations.
Some of the data from these simulations is saved regularly to
output files which can be plotted (afterwards, or at the
same time using a second ipython session) with the files
master3_plot.py and master4_plot.py.
